Dataset
The Heart Disease Prediction App utilizes a dataset obtained from [source-name]. This dataset contains various health parameters, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and others, along with corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. The dataset was preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

Model Training
The heart disease prediction model was trained using [machine learning algorithm(s)] on the provided dataset. The dataset was split into a training set and a testing set to assess the model's performance. Several evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, were used to measure the model's effectiveness. Hyperparameter tuning and feature selection techniques were applied to optimize the model's performance.
